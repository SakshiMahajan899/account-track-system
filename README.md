# Bank Application

## Description

This project simulates a simple bank account using Java, focusing on functionalities such as transferring and withdrawing money from an account. It supports payments using either debit or credit cards, with a 1% extra charge for transactions made with a credit card. The project also includes API endpoints to interact with the account, ensuring secure access through oauth token based authentication and authorization.

## Bank Application YAML

Within the resources/yaml folder, you'll find the AccountServiceAPI.yaml file, which details all the endpoints provided by the Bank Application.

## Requirements

- Eclipe/Intellij
- Java17
- Maven
- Git
- Docker (Optional)

## Steps to Run the Application

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SakshiMahajan899/bank-application.git
   cd bank-application

2. **Build the project:**
   mvn clean install

3. **SSL Certificate**
To secure the Application endpoints, keystore.p12 is placed in the resources folder of Bank Application and also configuration provided in the application yaml file which helps to Enable HTTPS .

4. **Run the application:**
   mvn spring-boot:run

5. **Access the application:**
   - https://localhost:8080

## Using H2 Database 
 
  This project uses an H2 in-memory database for development and testing purposes. 

  ### Accessing H2 Database Console

   - Go to https://localhost:8080/h2-console.
   - JDBC Url is jdbc:h2:mem:recipedb
   - Provide username and password.
   - Click on "Connect" to access the H2 database console.

## Spring Security  
   
   - This application uses Spring Authorization Server framework which helps me to create my own OAuth2 Authorization Server (repo link mentioned below)
        https://github.com/SakshiMahajan899/oauth-authorization-server.git
   - To access the secure endpoints of Bank Application,  need to provide jwt token generated by using authorization server along with request details.
   - Bank Application will act as resource server and owner .
   - Authorization server consulted by Resource servers to authorize requests.
   - Two Clients are onboarded in the BankApplication one is User and Other is Admin .
   - For Client-id - user ,scopes defined are "user.read" and "user.write".
   - If token is generated using scope "user.read", then user is only authorize for calling getTansaction API.
   - If token is generated using scope "user.write"  then user is authorize for withdraw and transfer operations.
   - For Client-id - admin, scopes defined are "admin.audit" so admin is authorize for auditing of transaction of type                 WITHDRAW/TRANSFER
   - Below diagram shows how authentication and authorization works in Bank application

## Design Pattern

- Singleton Pattern: for Used the Database.
- Factory Pattern: Used for creating different card types (Debit or Credit) based on user input.
- Observer Pattern: Used for auditing transactions (i.e., when a transaction is made, the audit log is updated).

## Connection Polling
Connection pooling is used to manage database connections . Instead of opening and closing a new database connection every time an application needs to interact with the database (which can be resource-intensive), connection pooling allows the application to reuse existing database connections from a pool. 


 

## API Endpoints
All Request is https enabled and Authorization token is provided in the Header parameters.
