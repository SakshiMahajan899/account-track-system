# Bank Application

## Description

This project simulates a simple bank account using Java, focusing on functionalities such as transferring and withdrawing money from an account. It supports payments using either debit or credit cards, with a 1% extra charge for transactions made with a credit card. The project also includes API endpoints to interact with the account, ensuring secure access through oauth token based authentication and authorization.

## Bank Application YAML

Within the resources/yaml folder, you'll find the AccountServiceAPI.yaml file, which details all the endpoints provided by the Bank Application.

## Requirements

- Eclipe/Intellij
- Java17
- Maven
- Git
- Docker (Optional)

## Steps to Run the Application

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SakshiMahajan899/bank-application.git
   cd bank-application

2. **Build the project:**
   mvn clean install

3. **SSL Certificate**
To secure the Application endpoints, keystore.p12 is placed in the resources folder of Bank Application and also configuration provided in the application yaml file which helps to Enable HTTPS .

4. **Run the application:**
   mvn spring-boot:run

5. **Access the application:**
   - https://localhost:8080

## Using H2 Database 
 
  This project uses an H2 in-memory database for development and testing purposes. 

  ### Accessing H2 Database Console

   - Go to https://localhost:8080/h2-console.
   - JDBC Url is jdbc:h2:mem:recipedb
   - Provide username and password.
   - Click on "Connect" to access the H2 database console.

## Spring Security  
   
   - This application uses Spring Authorization Server framework which helps me to create my own OAuth2 Authorization Server (repo link mentioned below)
        https://github.com/SakshiMahajan899/oauth-authorization-server.git
   - To access the secure endpoints of Bank Application,  need to provide jwt token generated by using authorization server along with request details.
   - Bank Application will act as resource server and owner .
   - Authorization server consulted by Resource servers to authorize requests.
   - Below diagram shows how authentication and authorization works in Bank application
